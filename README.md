# Dwelling of Duels Utility Scripts

These scripts help with multiple steps in the monthly DoD flow of uploading to YouTube:
- Converting audio files (mp3) into video files (mp4) featuring a static image.
- Upload videos to the YouTube channel (authorization required), keeping track of the video IDs of each upload so we can use them later.
- Create a playlist for the monthly song set.
- Add all videos to playlist.
- Apply public visibility to all videos and playlists after confirmation of accuracy.
